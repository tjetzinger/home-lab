# Autonomous Epic Processing

**"Do Epic 4 for me" - Full automation of epic completion**

## What It Does

Autonomous epic processing combines just-in-time planning with automated development:

```
/autonomous-epic 2

→ Creates Story 2.1 → Develops with super-dev-story → Commits → Done ✅
→ Creates Story 2.2 → Develops with super-dev-story → Commits → Done ✅
→ Creates Story 2.3 → Develops with super-dev-story → Commits → Done ✅
...
→ Entire Epic 2 complete! 🎉
```

## How It Works

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Load any BMAD agent
/autonomous-epic

# Will prompt for epic number:
Enter epic number: 2

# Or provide directly:
/autonomous-epic epic-2
```

### With Defaults

```bash
/autonomous-epic 3

# Uses default settings:
# ✅ super-dev-story (comprehensive quality)
# ✅ Auto-accept gap analysis
# ✅ Create git commits
# ✅ Continue on errors
```

### With Custom Settings

```bash
/autonomous-epic 3

# When prompted:
[C] Custom settings

# Then configure:
# - dev-story or super-dev-story?
# - Auto-accept gap analysis?
# - Create git commits?
# - Halt on error or continue?
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings (workflow.yaml)

```yaml
autonomous_settings:
  use_super_dev: true              # Use super-dev-story (vs dev-story)
  auto_accept_gap_analysis: true   # Auto-approve gap analysis
  halt_on_error: false             # Continue even if story fails
  max_retry_per_story: 2           # Retry failed stories
  create_git_commits: true         # Commit after each story
  git_branch_prefix: "auto-epic-"  # Branch: auto-epic-{epic_num}

# Task-based completion verification (NEW)
completion_verification:
  task_based_completion: true       # Check actual tasks, not just status
  process_review_with_unchecked: true  # Process "review" stories with unchecked tasks
  process_done_with_unchecked: true    # Process "done" stories if tasks remain
  verify_after_development: true    # Re-check after each story
  strict_epic_completion: true      # Epic only done when ALL tasks complete
```

### Task-Based Completion (Important!)

**The autonomous epic workflow now uses TASK-BASED completion**, not just status-based:

| What Changed | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| "review" status | ⏭️ Skipped | ✅ Processed if unchecked tasks exist |
| "done" status | ⏭️ Skipped | ✅ Verified, processed if tasks remain |
| Completion check | Status-based | Task-based (count `- [ ]`) |
| Epic marked done | When all stories "done" | When ALL tasks `- [x]` |

**Why this matters:** Code reviews often add new tasks (CR-1, CR-2, etc.) that need implementation. The old workflow would skip these stories because they were marked "review". Now we scan for actual unchecked tasks.

```
📊 Epic 4 Status (Task-Based Analysis)

By Actual Task Completion:
- ✅ Truly Done: 0 (all tasks checked, will skip)
- 🔧 Needs Work: 7 (has unchecked tasks)
    4-1: 6 unchecked (CR tasks)
    4-2: 4 unchecked (original work)
    4-3: 7 unchecked (CR tasks)
    ...
- 📝 Backlog: 0 (will create + develop)
```

### Per-Epic Override

```yaml
# In sprint-status.yaml or epic frontmatter
epic-3:
  autonomous_settings:
    use_super_dev: false  # Use dev-story (faster)
    halt_on_error: true   # Stop on first failure
```

## Time & Cost Estimates

### Time per Story

| Workflow | Avg Time per Story | Token Usage |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **dev-story** | 20-40 minutes | 50K-100K |
| **super-dev-story** | 25-50 minutes | 80K-150K |

### Epic Estimates

| Epic Size | Time (dev-story) | Time (super-dev) | Tokens |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Small (3-5 stories) | 1-3 hours | 2-4 hours | 250K-750K |
| Medium (6-10 stories) | 2-7 hours | 3-8 hours | 500K-1.5M |
| Large (11-20 stories) | 4-13 hours | 5-17 hours | 1M-3M |

**Recommendation:** Run overnight for large epics

## Progress Tracking

### Progress File

Autonomous epic maintains state in `.autonomous-epic-progress.yaml`:

```yaml
epic_num: 2
started: 2025-01-18T10:00:00Z
total_stories: 8
completed_stories:
  - 2-1-user-registration
  - 2-2-user-login
failed_stories: []
current_story: 2-3-password-reset
status: running
```

### Resume from Interruption

If interrupted (crash, manual stop, timeout):

```bash
/autonomous-epic 2

# Detects existing progress file
# Shows: "Found in-progress epic processing. Resume? [Y/n]"
# Continues from last completed story
```

## Error Handling

### Story Failures

**With `halt_on_error: false` (default):**
```
Story 2.3 fails
→ Logged in failed_stories
→ Continue to Story 2.4
→ Report failures at end
```

**With `halt_on_error: true`:**
```
Story 2.3 fails
→ Stop processing immediately
→ Report error
→ User fixes manually
→ Resume from Story 2.3
```

### Retry Logic

Each story gets {{max_retry_per_story}} attempts (default: 2):

```
Story 2.5 fails
→ Retry 1/2: Attempt again
→ Retry 2/2: Attempt again
→ Max retries: Mark failed, continue to next story
```

## Git Integration

### Automatic Branching

```bash
# Autonomous epic creates:
Branch: auto-epic-{epic_num}

# Example:
/autonomous-epic 3
→ Creates branch: auto-epic-3
```

### Commits per Story

Each story gets its own commit:

```
feat(epic-2): complete story 2-1-user-registration
feat(epic-2): complete story 2-2-user-login
feat(epic-2): complete story 2-3-password-reset
...
```

### Merge When Done

```bash
# After autonomous epic completes:
git checkout main
git merge auto-epic-2

# Or create PR:
gh pr create --base main --head auto-epic-2 --title "Epic 2: User Management"
```

## Completion Report

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Epic Sizing

**Recommended epic sizes:**
- **Small (3-5 stories):** Can complete in single session
- **Medium (6-10 stories):** Overnight processing ideal
- **Large (11+ stories):** Consider breaking into sub-epics

### 2. Choosing dev-story vs super-dev-story

**Use super-dev-story for:**
- Security-critical epics
- Customer-facing features
- Complex business logic
- High-stakes production releases

**Use dev-story for:**
- Internal tools
- Experimental features
- Non-critical improvements
- When speed matters more than extra validation

### 3. Monitoring Progress

```bash
# In another terminal, watch progress:
watch -n 10 'cat docs/sprint-artifacts/.autonomous-epic-progress.yaml'

# Or tail completion report:
tail -f docs/sprint-artifacts/epic-2-completion-report.md
```

### 4. Interruption Handling

**Safe to interrupt:**
- Ctrl+C between stories (progress saved)
- Terminal disconnect (can resume)
- Timeout (restarts from last completed)

**Not safe to interrupt:**
- During story development (may leave partial work)
- During git commit (may corrupt repository)

### 5. Resource Management

**Token budgets:**
- Set LLM API limits to prevent runaway costs
- Monitor token usage in real-time
- Consider using dev-story for token savings

**Time management:**
- Run overnight for large epics
- Schedule during low-activity periods
- Use CI/CD for completely automated runs

## Troubleshooting

### "Autonomous epic stuck on one story"

**Cause:** Story has issues preventing completion
**Solution:**
- Check progress file for current_story
- Review that story's dev log
- May need manual intervention

### "Epic processing stopped mid-story"

**Cause:** Interruption during development
**Solution:**
- Check progress file status
- Resume with `/autonomous-epic {epic_num}`
- May need to manually clean up partial work

### "Too many token failures"

**Cause:** Hitting API rate limits
**Solution:**
- Reduce concurrent processing
- Use dev-story instead of super-dev-story
- Increase API tier/limits

### "Git merge conflicts after autonomous epic"

**Cause:** Other changes merged to main during processing
**Solution:**
- Rebase auto-epic branch on latest main
- Resolve conflicts manually
- This is expected for long-running processes

## Safety Features

### Max Retry Protection

Prevents infinite loops:
- Each story: max 2 retries (default)
- After max retries: skip to next story
- Report failures at end

### Progress Checkpoints

After each story:
- Progress file updated
- Git commit created (if enabled)
- Can resume from this point

### Fail-Safe Modes

```yaml
# Conservative (halt on first problem):
halt_on_error: true
max_retry_per_story: 0

# Aggressive (push through everything):
halt_on_error: false
max_retry_per_story: 3

# Balanced (default):
halt_on_error: false
max_retry_per_story: 2
```

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Overnight Epic Completion

```bash
# Before leaving office:
/autonomous-epic 4

# Next morning:
# → Epic 100% complete
# → All stories developed
# → All commits created
# → Ready for review
```

### Use Case 2: CI/CD Integration

```bash
# In GitHub Actions:
name: Auto Epic Processing
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      epic_number:
        required: true

jobs:
  process-epic:
    steps:
      - run: npx bmad-method@alpha autonomous-epic ${{ inputs.epic_number }}
```

### Use Case 3: Sprint Automation

```bash
# Monday: Plan all epics for sprint
/sprint-planning

# Tuesday: Auto-process Epic 1
/autonomous-epic 1

# Wednesday: Auto-process Epic 2
/autonomous-epic 2

# Thursday-Friday: Human review and merge
```

## Comparison to Manual Processing

### Manual Workflow

```
Day 1: Create Story 2.1 → Review → Approve (30m)
Day 2: Develop Story 2.1 → Test → Review → Fix → Done (4h)
Day 3: Create Story 2.2 → Review → Approve (30m)
Day 4: Develop Story 2.2 → Test → Review → Fix → Done (3h)
...

8 stories = 16 days minimum (with human bottlenecks)
```

### Autonomous Workflow

```
Day 1 (evening): /autonomous-epic 2
Day 2 (morning): Epic complete, review ready

8 stories = 6 hours machine time + 1-2 days human review
```

**Savings:** ~14 days, 90% reduction in calendar time

## Limitations

### What Autonomous Epic CAN'T Do

- **Complex requirement clarifications** - Needs human for ambiguous requirements
- **Architectural decisions** - Major tech choices need human input
- **UX design decisions** - Visual/interaction design needs human creativity
- **Business logic validation** - Domain expertise often needs human verification

### When to Use Manual Processing

- First epic in new project (learning patterns)
- Experimental features (high uncertainty)
- Stories requiring extensive research
- Complex integrations with unknowns

## Monitoring Output

### Real-Time Progress

```bash
# Terminal output shows:
Story 3/8: 2-3-password-reset
  Pre-gap: ✅ 2 tasks refined
  Development: ⏳ 2/6 tasks complete
  ...
```

### Progress File

```bash
# Check progress programmatically:
cat docs/sprint-artifacts/.autonomous-epic-progress.yaml

# Example:
epic_num: 2
status: running
completed_stories: [2-1-user-registration, 2-2-user-login]
current_story: 2-3-password-reset
```

### Completion Report

```bash
# Generated when epic completes:
cat docs/sprint-artifacts/epic-2-completion-report.md
```

## Advanced: Batch Epic Processing

Process multiple epics:

```bash
# Sequential processing:
/autonomous-epic 1
/autonomous-epic 2
/autonomous-epic 3

# Or create meta-workflow for parallel processing
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can I stop autonomous processing mid-epic?

**A:** Yes, Ctrl+C between stories. Progress saved. Resume with `/autonomous-epic {num}`

### Q: What if a story fails?

**A:** Logged in failed_stories. By default, continues to next story. Fix manually later.

### Q: Does this work with existing stories?

**A:** Yes! Picks up any ready-for-dev or in-progress stories and develops them.

### Q: Can I customize per story?

**A:** Not currently. All stories in epic use same settings. Manual development for custom needs.

### Q: What about dependencies between stories?

**A:** Stories processed sequentially, so Story 2.2 can leverage Story 2.1's code (gap analysis handles this!)

### Q: Token budget concerns?

**A:** Use dev-story instead of super-dev-story to reduce token usage by ~30%
